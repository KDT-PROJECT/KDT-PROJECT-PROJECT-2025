# ADR-001: Clean Architecture Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Seoul Commercial Analysis LLM System was initially implemented as a monolithic Streamlit application with tight coupling between components. This approach led to several issues:

1. **Testing Difficulty**: Components were tightly coupled, making unit testing challenging
2. **Maintainability**: Changes in one component often required modifications in multiple places
3. **Scalability**: The monolithic structure made it difficult to scale individual components
4. **Dependency Management**: Circular dependencies and unclear separation of concerns

## Decision
We will implement Clean Architecture principles to restructure the system into distinct layers:

### Architecture Layers

1. **Presentation Layer** (`presentation/`)
   - Streamlit UI components
   - Dashboard and visualization components
   - User interaction handling

2. **Orchestration Layer** (`orchestration/`)
   - System orchestrator for coordinating between layers
   - Query processor for handling user requests
   - Business logic coordination

3. **Data Layer** (`data/`)
   - Database management and repositories
   - ETL services for data processing
   - Data access abstractions

4. **Retrieval Layer** (`retrieval/`)
   - RAG services and hybrid search
   - Document indexing and retrieval
   - Search result processing

5. **LLM Layer** (`llm/`)
   - Text-to-SQL services
   - Report generation
   - LLM interaction abstractions

6. **Infrastructure Layer** (`infrastructure/`)
   - Logging services
   - Configuration management
   - Caching services
   - External dependencies

### Key Principles

1. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have only one reason to change
3. **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
4. **Open/Closed**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently with mocks
- **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Individual components can be scaled independently
- **Reduced Coupling**: Dependencies flow inward, reducing tight coupling
- **Easier Development**: New features can be added without affecting existing code

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: More files and abstractions to manage
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Clean Architecture principles
- **Initial Overhead**: More time required for initial setup and refactoring

### Risks
- **Over-engineering**: Risk of creating unnecessary abstractions
- **Performance Impact**: Additional layers may introduce slight performance overhead
- **Migration Complexity**: Existing code needs to be refactored to fit new architecture

## Implementation Plan
